  The Case of Jennifer Pan

    <h2 style="color:red;"> Backstory </h2> 
    <p style="font-family:courier;"> After fleeing Vietnam in 1979 with his wife, Huei Hann Pan and his wife, Bich Han Pan, settled in Markham, Canada to lead a better life (arrived seperately, met in Canada). Immediately upon marrying one another, they decided it would be best to have kids. They had 2 children in total: the eldest, Jennifer Pan, and the youngest, Felix Pan. Huei and Bich were very strict towards their children, because they didn't want their children to suffer the way they had back in Vietnam. With the high goals and expectations placed on them, the Pan children seemed almost perfect. Felix studied mechanical engineering, and was on his way to becoming a car designer. Jennifer on the other hand recieved piano and figure skating lessons, in hopes that she would become a Olympic-caliber figure skater, an award-winning pianist, and a straight-A student. Hann worked as a tool and diemaker, and his wife worked making car parts in the same factory, and after holding stable jobs for a time, they were able to accumulate a ton of money. With this money, they were able to buy a car, garage, and more, including a SAFE HOME IN THE SUBURBS.

    <h2 style="color:red;"> Building up to the attacks </h2>
    <p style="font-family:courier;"> Her high school years were a pivotal turning point in her life. During her elementary and middle school years, she was a straight A student. In high school, she began to fail her classes because the school she attended was quite intense grading-wise. Along with that, she tore a ligament and was no longer able to ice skate, which left her devastated. Because her parents monitered all her movements, she began to feel pressured to be perfect. What initially started as "I'll fix this habit to do better next semester" became "I'll print fake grades and glue them on top of my failing grades on my report card." Eventually, she met a boy by the name of Daniel in a marching band that they both participated in. Her obsession with Daniel started on a trip to Europe. Her parents allowed her to go on this trip to Europe with her band, because it would look good on her college applications. On the trip, she was stuck in a room full of smokers, including Daniel, and began to panic because she had asthma. He told her to take a breather outside, and she viewed his actions/words as life-saving.</p> <br> 
    <p style="font-family:courier;"> She began to live her life in deceit. She began to date, even though her parents didn't approve of dating (especially bad, because Daniel was a drug dealer.).  She continued to perform badly in school through her senior year, which had a bad impact on her college application proccess. Out of the several colleges she applied to, one accepted her, but they rescinded their offer when she failed her calculus class. She dropped out of highschool right after this incident (middle of the school year) and began to waitress, while informing her parents that she was at school. She faked her high school diploma, and asked her parents if she could move away from them to live closer to her school. They accepted. In reality, she was moving into an apartment with her boyfriend, Daniel, while faking her certificates and degrees. Her lies were uncovered by her father, when he found out she wasn't actually volunteering at a hospital. For a while, she had pretended to volunteer at a hospital, when in reality she was meeting up with Daniel. As Mr.Pan began to grow suspicious, and acted on his suspicions. He decided to drop her off at what she called her workplace, and immediatly realized- she didn't work here. He grounded her, took away her phone, tracked the milage on her car, etc.

    <h2 style="color:red;"> The murders</h2>
    <p style="font-family:courier;"> In 2010, she reconnected with a old friend by the name of Andrew. He talked about how he robbed people at gunpoint, and to this, Jennifer informed him that she despised her father. She also expressed that she wanted him dead. Andrew connected her with one of his hitmen friends, and together they set a plan, along with the time and date to murder her parents. They handed her a new phone to keep in contact with them before and after the killings...</p> 
    <br> <p style="font-family:courier;"> On the 8th of November 2010, 3 masked men broke into the Pan's house. Felix wasn't at home at the time. Jennifer was tied up on the top of the staircase, while Mr and Mrs. Pan were dragged into the basement, and shot (what's heartbreaking is that Mrs.Pan was begging the men not to kill Jennifer, not knowing Jennifer had planned the attack). Mrs.Pan died shortly after being shot in the head, but Mr.Pan survived, and was able to run outside and yell for help. Jennifer was shocked at the sight and panickingly called 911. What she didn't know, was that her father just barely heard her flirtatiously speaking to someone on the phone right after he was shot...
