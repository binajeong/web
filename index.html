    <h2> Swim </h2> 
    <p> I started swimming quite early in my life. My mother initially signed me and my brother up to swim when I was 3 and my brother was 4 as a means of survival. She didn't expect us to like swimming as much as we did. As we started to become more passionate about swimming, we began to improve immensely, to the point where the local swim team accepted us. My brother got in at the age of six, and being the child prodigy that he is, immediately caught the attention of many coaches, and qualified for many of the best meets. I also got in the swim team when I was 6, but I wasn't quite as good. The only similarity between me and my brother, swimming-wise, was that we both enjoyed swimming. We still swim to this day, and it has shaped us to be competitive and independant people. </p></li>
